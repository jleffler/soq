# Documentation

Originally, this directory held material destined for, or available
from, the Documentation (beta) project on Stack Overflow.
However, the Documentation project has been stopped:

* [Sunsetting Documentation](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/354217)
* [Documentation is read-only. What's next?](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/355115)

This now contains some material vaguely related to what Documentation
might have been.
It contains a few key sections from the 'last' status of Documentation.

There probably should be more recovered material.

It also contains drafts of what might become a C FAQ on 'undefined
references'.
See SO chat room [C Undefined
References](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/152916/c-undefined-references).
The triggering question was [Source file is required to include instead
of header](https://stackoverflow.com/q/45899270).
The question contains some links to the chat room, the C++ question, a
Google Sheet, etc.
