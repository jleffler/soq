This is a story about four people named Everybody, Somebody, Anybody and
Nobody.

There was an important job to be done and Everybody was sure that
Somebody would do it.  Anybody could have done it, but Nobody did it.
Somebody got angry about that, because it was Everybody’s job.
Everybody thought Anybody could do it, but Nobody realized that
Everybody wouldn’t do it.

It ended up that Everybody blamed Somebody when Nobody did what Anybody
could have.
