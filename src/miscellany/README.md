### The Miscellany Directory

This directory contains multiple programs that have appeared in my SOQ
repository at various times that do not have a simple correspondence
with an SO question.  Either there are many possible questions or no
questions could be found that matched, yet the program was created in a
context that suggests it was related to SO.

* `cmpfltint.c`:

  As noted, incomplete code based on Dr Dobb's Journal article

* `computist-1.c`:

  Need to track the origin of the problem (there are more questions).

* `computist-2.c`:

  Need to track the origin of the problem (there are more questions).

* `dec_to_hex.c`:

  Assembled in response to questions by Saurabh (look in gmail).

* `incunabulum-ancient.c`:

  Need to track down the origin of this (arcane, pre-standard K&R C).

  Probably not my code, but not clear how to identify who wrote it
  before I hacked it into the shape it is.

* `select.c`:

  Demonstration of how to use `select()` system call.

* `stld.cpp` and `stld.h`:

  Template-based integer loading and unloading as for C-ISAM, etc.
  Updated to overload functions `st_le()` and `st_be()` for type
  unsigned char to avoid warnings from Apple clang version 15.0.0
