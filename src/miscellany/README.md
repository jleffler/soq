### The Miscellany Directory

This directory contains multiple programs that have appeared in my SOQ
repository at various times that do not have a simple correspondence
with an SO question.  Either there are many possible questions or no
questions could be found that matched, yet the program was created in a
context that suggests it was related to SO.

  Need to track the origin of the problem (there are more questions).
