If your code works but you are seeking advice on how to improve it, then
you should probably post your question on
[Code Review](https://codereview.stackexchange.com),
but be sure to read their
[rules of engagement](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/about)
first (see also
[On Topic](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic)
and
[How to Ask](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask)).
