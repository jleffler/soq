#define macro for debug printing in C?

The file `answer.md` is my answer as currently posted.

As yet, the code is primarily embedded in that file.
You can find the `debug.c`, `debug.h`, `mddebug.c` and `mddebug.h` code
in the
[src/libsoq](https://github.com/jleffler/soq/tree/master/src/libsoq)
directory.
