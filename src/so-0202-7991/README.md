### Stack Overflow Question 0202-7991

[SO 0202-7991](https://stackoverflow.com/q/02027991) &mdash;
List of standard header files in C and C++

This is a no-code answer.
The formatted information is in the `answer.md` file.

The answer has been maintained over many years, and many releases of the
standards, and was finally put under version control in March 2023.

The various lists of headers for the standards are in the files.
The `*-h-headers` files contain the names of the `.h` headers; the
`*-c-headers` files contain the names of the `<cxyz>` headers that match
a `<xyz.h>` header; and the other `-headers` files contain the pure C++
headers.

The lists are formatted into the answer using `multicol -c4`.
The code for `multicol` is available on request.
